A fast, free open source browser programmed in XUL, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript

Amethyst is a free open source browser programmed in XUL, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. It uses XULRunner for its interface and Gecko as its layout engine. As such it has good support for HTML5 and CSS3. A project goal is to enable extensions, themes, and the tabbrowser in the future.
